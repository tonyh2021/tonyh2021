## Install an old brew package version

1. Create a local “tap” - which I assume is something like a local brew repository
2. Extract the desired version of the package into this local tap
3. Install local tap

```
# use $USER variable to mimick userName/repoName structure
# this does not actually create any git repositories
# 1. create a new tap
brew tap-new $USER/local-<packageName>
# 2. extract into local tap
brew extract --version=1.2.3 <packageName> $USER/local-<packageName>
# 3. run brew install@version as usual
brew install <packageName>@1.2.3
```
